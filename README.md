# CNG-476

## üìò Project Overview

This project simulates an IoT-based **Smart Small Grid Management System** using **LoRa communication** within the **OmNet++** simulation environment and the **FLoRa framework**. The goal is to create a realistic model of a small-scale smart grid that efficiently manages power outage detection and recovery through sensor-based monitoring and queue-driven event handling.

Each house in the system is equipped with smart sensors that detect power outages and report them to a central monitoring system using LoRa‚Äôs low-power, long-range communication. The central system evaluates outages, handles them using a FIFO queue, and coordinates technical teams for resolution, simulating both sensor and network uncertainties with stochastic methods.
